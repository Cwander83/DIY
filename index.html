        <p>The two Midwest state schools first met in 1897, and the rivalry has been played annually since 1918. The
            game has been
            played at the end of the regular season since 1935 (with the exceptions of 1942, 1986, and 1998). Since
            1918, the game's
            site has alternated between Columbus, Ohio, and Ann Arbor, Michigan (Michigan hosts it in odd years and Ohio
            State in
            even years), and has been played in Ohio Stadium since 1922 and Michigan Stadium since 1927. Through 2010,
            Ohio State
            and Michigan have decided the Big Ten Conference championship between themselves on 22 different occasions,
            and have
            affected the determination of the conference title an additional 27 times.
